<div class="panel-body">
<h3 id="werewolf">Werewolf</h3>
  <p>Every night they pick one person to kill. If they cannot decide in time they will not kill anyone</p>
<h3 id="hunter">Hunter</h3>
  <p>If he's about to die he can kill someone else</p>
<h3 id="witch">Witch</h3>
  <p>The witch knows who was killed by the werewolf, if she has her healing potion that is. </p>
  <p>In that case she may heal the wounded person to save their life. </p>
  <p>She also has a killing potion, allowing her to kill any person during nighttime.</p>
  <p>Important to note: She may heal herself in advance to get an additional life.</p>
<h3 id="healer">Healer</h3>
  <p>The Healer gets to heal 1 person every night. </p>
  <p>However, unlike the witch, he/she has no idea who was attacked. </p>
<p>The Healer may only heal him/herself once and may not heal the same person twice in a row.</p>
<h3 id="oracle">Oracle</h3>
  <p>At the start of the night the oracle gets to choose one person and i will tell the oracle their role.</p>
<h3 id="amor">amor</h3>
  <p>In the first night the Amor gets to choose two people.</p>
  <p> Those two players will fall in love and instantly start teaming up, no matter their roles. </p>
  <p>The couple can only win if <p>
<p>1) Both of the lovers are from the town:</p>
<p>Every werewolf and the town has to die</p>
<p>2) One of the lovers is a Werewolf:</p>
<p>The entire town has to die</p>
<p>3) Both lovers are Werewolves:</p>
<p>The entire town and the Werewolves have to die.</p>
<h3 id="spy">Spy</h3>
  <p>The spy gets to pretend to be a werewolf and joins their chat.</p>
  <p>He gets to vote on the person who gets killed and his vote does count.</p>
    <p>However, as usual he may not reveal any roles, he may not hint at any roles and - most importantly - If the werewolves find out who he is, he dies Instantly. </p>
    <p>Not even the Witch/Healer can save him. Said death does not count as the killed person for the werewolves, meaning they may kill an additional person.</p>
<h3 id="wolf">Lone Wolf</h3>
  <p>The lone wolf only wins if he is the last remaining werewolf. </p>
  <p>He may not kill any of his fellow werewolves at night, but he may accuse them during daytime.</p>
<h3 id="villager">Villager</h3>
  <p>The villager have nothing special.</p>
